Week 1

This week I used AI mainly for coding help. I asked for examples of functions I was struggling with and also tried to troubleshoot some problems I was having with VS Code. Unfortunately, the information I got wasn’t fully correct, so I ended up switching over to Google Colab to continue my work. Even though it wasn’t always accurate, I still found AI useful to double-check my code whenever I got stuck or needed another perspective.

Week 2
This week i used AI for help with the Week 2 excersize. Was having troubling figuring out where to start for a few of the questions so it gave me a few ideas where to begin.
My team and I also used AI to brainstorm ideas for the Project. 

Week 3
This week I used AI to help me better understand the concepts in my exercises. I also had it write some code so I could see how the solutions worked.

Week 4
This week I used AI for help with the weekly exercise. I had it give feedback on my code and give examples of how to better structure my code. It helped me double-check my approach and understand the logic behind it.

Week 5
This week I used AI to help me come up with ideas for our library of functions and to make our README section look more organized and easier to read. I also used it while working on the coding exercises to help me understand what the code was actually doing and why it worked that way. It made things a lot clearer and helped me learn the concepts better while keeping everything for the project neat and easy to follow.

Week 6 
This week I used AI to explain concepts and provide example implementations for classes, instances, and static methods. I relied on AI to clarify how to structure classes, use helper methods, and work with class attributes. AI also helped simplify code and provided examples for debugging when needed.

Week 7
This week, I used AI to help with Python exercises and my project. It provided guidance on handling exceptions, writing functions, and testing my code. It also helped me figure out how to structure classes and integrate our function library effectively. I used it to explore different approaches, check my logic, and get suggestions when I ran into problems.
