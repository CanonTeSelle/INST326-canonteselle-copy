Week 1

This week I used AI mainly for coding help. I asked for examples of functions I was struggling with and also tried to troubleshoot some problems I was having with VS Code. Unfortunately, the information I got wasn’t fully correct, so I ended up switching over to Google Colab to continue my work. Even though it wasn’t always accurate, I still found AI useful to double-check my code whenever I got stuck or needed another perspective.

Week 2
This week i used AI for help with the Week 2 excersize. Was having troubling figuring out where to start for a few of the questions so it gave me a few ideas where to begin.
My team and I also used AI to brainstorm ideas for the Project. 

Week 3
This week I used AI to help me better understand the concepts in my exercises. I also had it write some code so I could see how the solutions worked.

Week 4
This week I used AI for help with the weekly exercise. I had it give feedback on my code and give examples of how to better structure my code. It helped me double-check my approach and understand the logic behind it.
